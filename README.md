# Blind-helper
Blindhelper is a smart android application using Artificial intelligence to bring sight to visually impaired and low vision people by turning the visual world into an audible experience. This application can be accessed using voice assistant and simple swiping actions on the screen. In this application, the User can recognize the objects including color detection, some blind peoples don't remember the task for that our application will set a reminder, the User can quickly contact other persons, and the User can easily read the messages or sends the message. I have also implemented an e-payment system for the blind so that users can quickly transfer money with their account number or phone number.  Users can also use a calculator to perform mathematical operations in this app. If the user wants to know the current location or to reach the destination our app will help. Other features are OCR Reader which will read printed text, To learn the current weather of cities. Users can listen to music, App also tells another device's status. I have implemented these features in one application. All these features users can handle by just speaking….. e.g.:- I want to detect the object, then the app will detect theobjectsongs.![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/117820507/200809354-98412890-b098-4163-852a-ba35471d8380.png)
